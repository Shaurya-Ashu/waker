# waken
A ESP powered Smart watch which gives you a little zap to wake you up silently without disturbing anyone around you.

# why I built it ?
Ahhhh! I'm not crazy, I just sleep like a stone . So to get me up on time, I caught an idea why not make a watch which sits on my wrist and give me a little zap of 400V (\j) to wake me up .

# Shematics 
I've used EasyEDA for design designing this project

 It has ESP32S3-WROON-1-N16R8 as the main brains , it has been built RTC and feature both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth with access to multiple GPIOs .

 For tracking motion and physical activities like step count, etc. I've used MPU6500 which features both I2C & SPI interface. I've used I2C interface for this project.

 For sensing temperature I used MCP9808 which also offers I2C interface so its easy to wire all of them in signle bus

 The heart rate sensor is MAX30101 with I2C interface which offers optical pulse oximetry and heart-rate sensing .

 To charge the lipo battery i have integrated a charging ic for 1s lipo and also integrated a load sharing circuit so that i can use teh device while charging .

 To provide a constant supply of 3.3 V I am integrated a buck boost converter output of 3.3V @1.5A

 Now for that little zap i have used a simple fly back circuit with a couple inductor of scale 1:100 and IRLR7843 N chaneel mosfet to turn it on and off and a some massive 400v rated caps to store the build up with a series resistance of 150K ohm for safety .

For Inputs and outputs we have 2 push buttons and a side scroll wheel with oled and buzzers as our output

# PCB 
 I have used 4 layer configuration

 
Top layer:- signals and some components

<img width="528" height="504" alt="Screenshot 2026-07-18 at 7 22 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7daee52-7085-4899-b205-fe2e8f192809" />


First inner layer:- ground

Second inner layer:- VCC

Bottom layer:- signal and all other components

<img width="533" height="499" alt="Screenshot 2026-07-18 at 7 22 23 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b92644fa-98d8-4cb4-a602-5b144a6188bb" />


Important Note : I have not connected the ground of flyback with the rest of the circuit I will use a physical wire to connect when I receive a PCB.

# CAD 

I have used fusion 360 student edition for designing the 3D case for this watch

It is a very simple case on which the PCB is screwed using two screws, and the top part is tucked in and glued

The pcb is screwed in

# Firmware 
 I stated a very brief sample test code till now. When I will receive my PCB, then I will work on the rest of the firmware.
